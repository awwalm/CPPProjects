# C++ Projects

A curated list of the first set of C++ programs I wrote while learning the language starting in 2019.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

At the moment of writing, the source code was written with C++ 11 and compiled with the GNU GCC/G++ compiler with MinGW.

This is particularly important if you intend to use Visual Studio as the Microsoft C++ compiler isn't 100% compatible with the GNU compiler.

*ProgrammingKnowledge* has an excellent [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXW2VLrQ3Bs) on the installation of MinGW.
